### Installation

In the command palette (CMD + SHIFT + P) select ‚ÄúInstall Extension‚Äù and choose "VS Code Deprecated".

### Behind the scenes

We plug into VSCode and use the hover functionality to find deprecated identifiers. So if your project is configured properly and the VS Code hover shows you that tiny deprecated warning, we will show it, too.
